## Formatting
Code formatting improves readability & transports Meaning. That has 2 kinds of formatting: Vertical (Space between lines and Grouping of codes) and Horizontal (Identation, Space between Code, and Line width)
### Vertical Formatting
1. Code should be readable like an essay - top to bottom without too many "jumps"
   * Consider splitting files with multiple concepts (e.g. classes) into multiple files
   * Different concepts ("areas") should be separated by spacing
   * Similar concepts ("areas") should not be separated by spacing
   * Related concepts should be kept close to each other
### Horizontal Formatting
1. Lines of code should be readable without scrolling - avoid very long "sentences"
   * Use indentation (tab/space/enter) - even if not required technically
   * Break long statements into multiple shorter ones (define to another variable)
   * Use clear but not unreadably long names
