# Code Structure, Comment & Formatting
## Comments
### What Things Make Bad Comments
1. Redundant Information
2. Divider / Block Markers
3. Misleading Comments
4. Comments-Out Code

### What Things Make Good Comments
1. Legal Information
2. Explanation which can't be replaced by good naming
3. Warning
4. Todo Notes

## Formatting
Code formatting improves readability & transports Meaning. That has 2 kinds of formatting: Vertical (Space between lines and Grouping of codes) and Horizontal (Identation, Space between Code, and Line width)
### Vertical Formatting
1. Code should be readable like an essay - top to bottom without too many "jumps"
   * Consider splitting files with multiple concepts (e.g. classes) into multiple files
   * Different concepts ("areas") should be separated by spacing
   * Similar concepts ("areas") should not be separated by spacing
   * Related concepts should be kept close to each other
### Horizontal Formatting
1. Lines of code should be readable without scrolling - avoid very long "sentences"
   * Use indentation (tab/space/enter) - even if not required technically
   * Break long statements into multiple shorter ones (define to another variable)
   * Use clear but not unreadably long names
