# Function & Methods
## What Makes Up a Function?
1. Working with the function should be easy/readable, _because the length of the function body matters_
2. Calling the function should be readable, _because the number and order of arguments matter_
   * Minimize the number of parameters (2 or 3 parameters are fine to read/readable if you want to have more you can save it in an object, array etc )
   * Try to avoid output arguments - especially if they are unexpected
