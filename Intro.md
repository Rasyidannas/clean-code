# Clean Code
---
## What is a Clean Code? 
1. Should be readable and meaningful
2. Should reduce cognitive load
3. Should be concise and "to the point"
4. Should avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting, and big code blocks
5. Should follow common best practices and patterns
6. Should be fun to write and maintain

## Key Pain Points and Solutions
1. Pain points:
     * Names (variables, functions, and classes)
     * Structure & Comments (code formatting, and good or bad comments)
     * Function (length, and parameters)
     * Conditional & Error Handling (deep nesting, and missing error handling)
     * Classes & Data Structure (missing distinction, and bloated classes)
2. Solutions:
     * Rules & Concepts
     * Pattern & Principle
     * Test-Driven Development
     * Refactor your code, why? because you will always find ways of improving your code and as your project evolves and changes, your code will need to change
  
## What is different between Clean Code and Clean Architecture
Clean code is about how to write the code (focus on single problems/files) but clean architecture is about where to write which code (focus on the project as a whole)
